Reaction
========

Reaction is a library for asynchronous and reactive programming, and is an implementation of Async Observables (`ReactiveX <http://reactivex.io/>`_) for F# and `Fable <http://fable.io/>`_. Reaction makes it easy to compose and combine streams of asynchronous event based data such as timers, mouse-moves, keyboard input, web requests and enables you to do operations such as:

- Filter
- Transform
- Aggregate
- Combine
- Time-shift

Reaction was designed spesifically for targeting `Fable <http://fable.io/>`_ which means that the code may be `transpiled <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler>`_ to JavaScript, and thus the same F# code may be used both client and server side for full stack software development.

See `Fable Reaction <https://github.com/dbrattli/Fable.Reaction>`_ for use of Reaction with Elmish and the model view update (MVU) style architecture.
